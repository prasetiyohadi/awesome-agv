description: When working on a Flutter or React Native mobile application, setting up mobile project structure
---

## Flutter/Mobile Layout

Use this structure for Flutter or React Native mobile applications. The vertical slice principle applies — features are self-contained modules.

```
  apps/
    mobile/                           # Mobile application source code (Flutter)
      lib/
        core/                         # Foundational concerns (the "Framework")
          di/                         # Dependency injection setup (get_it, riverpod)
            injection.dart            # Service locator / provider registration
          network/                    # HTTP client setup, interceptors
            api_client.dart           # Dio/http client with base config
            api_interceptor.dart      # Auth token, logging interceptors
          storage/                    # Local storage abstractions
            local_storage.dart        # SharedPreferences / Hive wrapper
          theme/                      # App theming
            app_theme.dart            # ThemeData, color schemes
            app_typography.dart       # TextStyles, font families
          router/                     # Navigation / routing
            app_router.dart           # GoRouter / auto_route config
          constants/                  # App-wide constants

        features/                     # Business Features (Vertical Slices)
          task/                       # Task management feature

              task_cubit_test.dart     # Unit tests for state logic

            models/

              task_logic.dart         # Pure business rules

        shared/                       # Shared across features
          widgets/                    # Reusable UI components (NO domain logic)
            app_button.dart

        integration_test/             # Integration / E2E tests
          task_flow_test.dart

      pubspec.yaml                    # Dependencies
      analysis_options.yaml           # Lint rules
```

**Key differences from web frontend:**
- `screens/` replaces `views/` — mobile uses screen-based navigation
- `widgets/` replaces `components/` — Flutter's terminology
- `state/` replaces `store/` — BLoC/Cubit/Riverpod instead of Pinia/Redux
- `repository/` replaces `api/` — mobile often caches data locally
- `core/di/` handles dependency injection (get_it, riverpod)
